This Org will be an place for all your old Repositories which contain code that is too good to delete but too old/obsolete to maintain.

We all have that kind of projects.


## Promises
* I will not change your code. It's a graveyard and since Zombies does not exist, there will nothing happen.
* I will not delete your code. Keeping repos here does not cost anything. 

## How to
The only thing you have to do is to transfer ownship of the code you want to have here to the org `github-graveyard`. That's it. :smile:
